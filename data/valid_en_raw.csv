","hello my name is mullet4superman but respond to the names amboyslim , dhylan and denzel . i 'm a filipino brought to and raised in the beautiful country of wales . i 've been writing since i was a little boy and people have been complaining since . my writing style has been described as a clumsy , uninspired attempt to replicate superior yet still mediocre source material . hopefully mrs glennon was just having a bad day when she wrote that . i mean usually she would just use one of those stamps marked 'very good ' or 'disappointed ' . found this sub once i made a reddit account and thought it could help inspire me to become a better writer . i barely get motivation to get out of bed most days so when inspiration blooms , i try to squeeze out as much as i can and turn it into words . i can get about 30 words per minute on a good day . but then again , because of who i am as a person , i probably end up with a net of 5 words per minute .
