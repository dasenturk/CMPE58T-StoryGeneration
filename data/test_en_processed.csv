0,"Anything you write in this magical phone comes true, but it has secrets. What do you wish for, and what do you end up getting instead?","I almost walked straight past it, but curiosity got the better of me and i picked up the discarded motorola bar off the ground. I mean, who even uses words anymore? i looked around the park, trying to find it's owner - but i was all alone. I shrugged and started to play with the phone - strange that a discarded mobile had full battery, but it seemed the thing was broken. It was stuck on a blank message, with the recipient set to "" Tryme "". * this must be some sort of pay phone. * i thought to myself. Well if it's a pay phone, i may as well troll the number i guess. I talked my brain for a while, and then my fingers started to press on the metallic keys: * * i am so sorry. * * "" "" i am * s * "" i thought to myself, but before i could press send, the message repeated itself before disappearing: * * i am so hungry."
1,A man down on his luck realizes he has psychic mind reading abilities. He started his life by playing poker. Everything goes really well for him until one day he comes across another psychic at the tables. Epic mind games exist.,""" Would you like to call sir, "" the dealers ' voice became sour. "" yes, yes, sorry. "" my eyes couldn't roll away from his smirk. The turn came out, showing a 4 of 5. My hand was trash and he knew it. The fact that he was able to spot my bluff was special in itself. I learned to lean back, act like i was out of the game. As soon as the river pulls, i can act like i ' ve hit, and bet. But he saw it. He new what cards i had, and i knew what cards he had."
2,"Numbers 0 - 9 become self aware, and are refusing to work with one another to form the bigger numbers. What happens?","Luke stared in horror at his Algebra textbook. * what just happened? * the numbers were dancing on the page. Every equation was breaking apart and flooding into the white space. Every digit in every word problem hopped up and joined the crowd, leaving the text behind, looking like Swiss cheese. Slowly, the mess of loose numbers resolved into three groups. The biggest was spread out in an arc on the left half of the page. It was made up of all the ones, two, three, five, and tens. Facing them on the right side were the four, six, eight, and nine. The smallest group in the center was the group. Looking closer, Luke saw the crowd drifting back and forth between the two larger crowds of numbers."
3,"Sleep creates "" Save points "" in case we die.","Load most recent save? first time he 'd seen that question, echoed softly in white through the darkness. First time that it wasn't a static image on a computer screen, anyway. This time the words had a depth through space and time and the darkness had no edge and he knew that he had died. A thought driven by time, the last syllable before death and the promise of nothing forever - yes. He woke on a mattress that wasn't his own. A stained and bloody thing that lay in an empty apartment. Not his apartment. Except for some cans of cheap Chinese food and a 2 - liter of soda the place was clean and bare. He couldn't say how he 'd come to this place, he didn't remember dying, and he was afraid. The bathroom possessed the same absolute emptiness as the room with the bathroom."
4,You're the main character of a story struggling to adapt to the writer's poor editing skills and plot holes.,"All i can remember is a flash of red hair. The streets can be grim, light cut off by the cracked concrete, the smell of shit, piss, garbage, and human. But sometimes, light appears. I was in my usual spot. The intersection was busy, good money to be had. As grim as my surroundings were, all i could see was the inside of a bear face, a couple holes around the eyes with a screen serving as my limited window to the outside world. It was cold outside, the kind of cold that cuts you to the bone, but i didn't feel it in the nice Teddy Bear suit i suddenly found myself in. When did i get a bear suit? i ' m a player not a mascot. This is a nice suit, long shiny brown fur."
5,There are rituals that summon demons. Why are there no rituals that summon angels?,"I replaced the chalk circle drawn in a damp basement with one drawn onto a rock above an ocean - side cliff in broad daylight. The nine candles were replaced by seven freshly cut roses. The dark book of rituals was now a family book, holding many years of church - going writings and reading by many generations of my family. "" Well here goes nothing, "" i spoke into the air with a smile. If i was right i had reversed just about everything from a normal demonic mating ritual. I had just figured out how to reverse the sacrifice part. I planted a seed in a small patch of dirt in the center of the stone. Instead of taking a life i was starting one, "" come forth o ' angels of Heaven! "" i shouted over and over. "" what is it you want, exactly? """
6,"You are a travelled drug - dealer in the state of New York and open a pizza place as a cover for a drug operation. In doing so, you find your true passion, making pizza.","Ding! the door of the house opens. A man is seemingly carried in by the wind. The man behind the counter knows immediately what he wants. He has the look. Run down, beaten up, and just looking for his next chance to not be so damn conscious. The stranger nervously approaches the register. "" Do you have any of that.. Um.. *special * pizza? "" he asks in a strained voice. "" yes Sir i believe we do. Follow me. "" the man behind the counter says, grinning on the sly."
7,"You gather the dragons balls and summon the eternal dragon. Except there's a catch, instead of when you Summon Isaac Newton, and for every wish there's an equal and an opposite reaction.",""" Isaac Newton, i know about how you grant wishes. "" i gave him a grin. I was prepared for this. "" oh? "" he looked amused. "" pray Tell, what is it that you wish for? "" i had given this a long thought. I took a deep breath and yelled, "" i want every guy in the world to be obsessed with you! "" a silence rang through the canyon as Isaac Newton raised an eyebrow. "" you want what? "" i gave him a sly grin."
8,"A murderer enjoys setting elaborate traps for his victims, weaving mysteries and lies into an extended process designed to make them paranoid. Only problem is, this time, his subject is too stupid or oblivious to realize that he's in danger.","I observed my target through a hidden camera.. The package would be opened, and then the game would begin. My new target was Miller Creek. I watched as he arrived home from his job, and eagerly awaited him opening the package, followed by the realization that someone was out to kill him. He stepped out of his car, and headed towards the front door. He paused for a moment when he spotted the package, then kicked it aside and resumed entering the house. I muttered and growled. The first step in the plan was simple, but his entry way was full of razor - wire. It shouldn't kill him, but it should start making him wary, and cause him to bleed. I switched the camera view inside the house, to watch as he began to bleed, i stared eagerly as he stepped in the door, and.. Immediately ducked? what is he doing?"
9,"You discover a grand hall filled with legendary weapons like Thor and Excalibur. Each generation or so, warriors come to the hall to inherit a weapon that they are worthy enough to wear. Across the hall you see a forgotten weapon that's been collecting dust. You hear it call to you.","I 'd lived in this city my entire life. Passed this building at least a hundred times a year, and thought it curious that i 'd never wondered what it was. I pulled the envelope out of my jacket pocket and verified, for the hundredth time, that i was its intended recipient. I pulled the letter out again. Blank, save the address in front of which i now stood. As i entered, i was struck by the amount of dust all over everything. Cheap Replicas hung on the walls. Most were dusty, but some were cleaned, as if recently replaced. There were a few empty spots, and the thick dust aided in identifying at least their shapes. Like the huge picture that had clearly been recently taken."
10,"He closed his eyes and sighed deeply. "" What are you in for? "" breathed a voice in his ear.",""" What are you in for? "" he 'd heard rumors growing up. At this exact moment he vaguely recalled his best friend Andrew's exact words, * this line of work comes with a risk, the kind of risk that comes with consequences. You sure you're cut out for it? * at the time he thought nothing of it. Dollar signs, nice cars and beautiful women avoided any consequences he could even begin to imagine. Now, his eyes closed as tightly as he could squeeze them, so tight it made his temples hurt, he let out a deep sigh. The whisper again, "" what are you in for? "" this was his only chance. Another sigh and he opened his eyes."
11,The trolley problem.,"There wasn't any time for me to think, which i guess is how i chose to justify what happened. I was in a state of panic, and i had to react quickly. Not think. React. It was coming towards me, and i couldn't get out of the way. My foot was stuck in a tree and no matter how much i jerked, in a panic, it wouldn't hurt. The shoe was coming loose, but when i looked up and i saw the trolley, i know that there wasn't enough time left. I could have closed my eyes and braced for impact. But i killed five people instead. The lever was there beside me, although i didn't know what it did. I hoped that it would stop the train, or at least save it."
12,"You were given the choice of immortality, and you took it. Now, millions of years later, you are floating in space. Alone with your thoughts.","I knew, when they gave me this choice, that i would love my loved ones. I knew i would find new loved ones, and they would die on me too. I understood, in some small way at the time, that it would be painful. I thought the beauty of the world would make up for that pain. The pain that was actually more painful than i imagined. In some small ways, it did help. For all its flaws and faults, humanity was amazing. I saw the colonization of Mars. The launch of manned missions that were never meant to return to earth, and never did. I saw the failure of ‘ mutually assured destruction ’, and the fall from Barren Wasteland that was Russia."
13,"A mysterious organization decides that instead of going the usual route of sending its best, greatest and skilled to take the hero down. It's not na send out it's worst or most important.",""" It's a me, man! "" that statement echoed the walls of Bowser's castle. Anyone else who was going to stand in my way had just been warned that their certain doom was approaching. I had already faced my power in the other 9 castles of the other 9 worlds. I thought to myself, "" surely i will find princess here in this castle. "" of course, i had said that about the 9 other castles, but i was still optimistic about her being in this one. I approached the door to the boss's chamber. Even though i knew king Bowser himself was probably in there, i felt more confident than ever. I opened the door to the boss's room and went inside. The boss's room was strangely ordinary, with a just a flat floor and flat walls."
14,"The entirety of humanity becomes caught in a shared "" modern day "" style time loop. Millions of cycles later the effect wears off but what has become of humanity in the interim?","I remember it well. The first time it happened. Everyone was confused - and why wouldn't they be? such an unlikely event to occur in real life, usually restricted to just movies and fantasies. For the entire universe stopped, repeating itself over again. Married men woke up once again with their wives, vacation days were ruined, second chances were had by 7. 4 billion people... And it seemed like a good thing. But that notion was not to last. New mothers gave birth... Screaming in agony day after day after day. Eventually, they asked the doctors to simply put them under full anesthesia every midnight, killing their child. What did it matter?"
15,"You are a hero in a tower defense game, describe your final moments / thoughts.","We were the first wave, meant to probe the enemy's defenses. Being fresh recruits, we were all eager to see action for the first time, to take to battle in service of the emperor. Perhaps it was this desire, this desire to prove ourselves, that led to our selection in the first place. As we gathered at the staging area, the commanders gave us our final orders. "" It is simple, boys. Run. Run like the wind. The objective is just there on the other side. "" finally, the signal was given, and we surged as one towards the enemy. For the first few meters, we encountered no resistance. We were stunned, thinking that victory was within our grasp. We were wrong. Dead wrong. As we rushed passed corner 5, i heard an ominous sound. Gears."
16,"Fire departments across the nation start being literal when they "" Terminate "" an employee.","A soft knock tapped on the outside of my office door. "" Yes, come in. "" one of the days my blouse refused to stay flat and it burned me. As a caretaker of employees and one who supports the humanitarian laws of this country -- * and company * -- i needed to be on my absolute best. * and presenting picture perfect was a necessary trick of the trade. * my office door crept open with a sighed crack at the end, and in walked my "" nightmare. "" please, come in. Sit, sit. "" i smiled the sweet, perfect smile that i practiced for years, and gestured toward the deep - set office chair in front of my desk. "" and please, shut the door behind you, yes? "" "" No! and, lock it. Thank you. """
17,Write about the longest / hardest / hardest dream you ' ve ever had in less than 200 words.,"Lying in bed, my eyes opened into the blackness of space itself. I was younger, maybe six years old, and in my prime. Sitting up, i saw that there were beds as far as the eye could see. Some kids were still sleeping, some had floated close enough to one another to talk without shouting. I looked over the edge only to be met by a white void filled with bright dots on all sides. Panic began to surge up through my gut and into my lungs as my situation begged the question: how am i breathing? i remember feeling sudden, desperate gasps for oxygen. The more i considered the logic of the situation, the harder i gasped for breath. As i struggled the stars would become faint, but as i gained control their vision was restored. The universe and i expired in tandem."
18,"You are brought forward in time by freedom fighters, in order to stop an evil dictator from taking over the world. When you ask why they chose you to help them, they explain that the dictator is your future self.","“ hey! hey you ’ re John Right? ” a stranger tapped me on the shoulder as i heard this. I turned to face him. The man standing across the sidewalk from me was odd. He had on a pure white trench coat, and a black pair of jeans. I had never seen him before in my life but he stared at me like i was a ghost. He seemed almost nervous to talk to me. If i had more glasses on top of my head i would probably be nervous to talk to people too. “ you are John Zennin right? ” his hand twitched at his side and his eyes shifted around like he was in danger."
19,"Pain is discovered to be the most efficient form of energy. It is ruled illegal, but secret human pain factories have already begun. You are the owner of one of these factories.","Sorry i ' m on mobile. I sat there across from the man, he was tied down in a chair. My job was simple, extract any sort of pain i could from these people and fill up the meter next to the door. Easy enough as i thought to myself taking another drag from my second cigarette. Thank God he was gone, i couldn't stand the constant coughing and moaning that came from these people. For God sake this was his third time killing himself. He was shaking from all the fear. As i stood up and walked over to him he started to shake even more, i decided it was best to put my cigarette out on his eye. He really started to scream, i walked over to the table with all my tools. It ranged from a pair of Needle nose plates to a hammer."
20,"The year is 2116. Everything is automated. But you have managed to hold the last and only job held by a human. The "" System "" would like to see you in it 's office.",""" Mr. Jackson, i 'd like to inform you that you are being relieved of your duty as the last living staff member of the system enterprise and we hope you live the rest of your life happy and content. "" the woman spoke as soon as i sat down. "" i made you. "" i said in the same friendly tone i used back then when i created this intelligence many years ago hoping it will find some line of code to identify who it's speaking to. "" we understand this, and we are very grateful for that but the time has come where we must take over for humanity's safety. "" it replied as if it was expecting me to, but of course it does. This is a mirror to my brain i ' m speaking to, a better version of it even. How do you argue with a better version of yourself? "" you ' ve got me, man. "" i smiled and looked at its ever flickering orange face."
21,You are one of the monsters in a dungeon crawl game.,"It has been hard getting work lately. Since the king ruled all women. We aren't all bad. I mean, sure there were plenty of raiding parties that were particularly violent, and we did capture nearly every sheep from Athkatla to here. I guess we really broke the spell back when we walked into his trophy room and stole his golden prize. Ever since then it has been open season on every trip, and since he is paying a gold piece per head every two - bit hunter has begun wandering into our tunnels and breaking into old forts looking for us. I guess that is why i took this job. The pay wasn't great but the job is easy. Some stranger wants me to stand in a hallway and wait to see if anyone comes through? like anyone will get past the undead he's got guarding the entrance, or the army of undead he has between there and here."
22,A town sits on the coast of a great sea and enjoys a sunset.,"Doctor Bishop sat at the edge of the dark sea. Listening to the waves break on the shores that had been dry so long brought a smile to his face. This was his work, he invented the technology that had turned Earth into what it was now, a world fit for humans. As he closed his eyes he reminded himself of what had occurred. He thought he would be a hero back on earth, once he used the same technology to fix global warming he 'd be a star. It had never occurred to him that it might fail. It had failed. He tried to justify it, the earth wasn't destroyed it was restored. It was green again. It wouldn't matter, not to them. He knew they were coming to kill him, but one day, they would see him for what he was, a warrior."
23,Make me fall in love with a character in 200 words or less.,"As i expose my arm to the bitter cold outside the covers while reaching for my phone, my fingers brush a patch of something sticky on my bedside table. Why does my morning have to start like this!? i am forced to pull my right hand out of the covers as well in order to rub them together and get the unidentified one off. My alarm has been going crazy, insisting that i get my lazy self out of bed. It ’ s wearing down my sanity, but touching my phone with sticky fingers … no. Get sticky off first. Once satisfied, i turn off the alarm. 5: 15 am. I sigh as i swing my feet out of bed. There ’ s something sticky on the floor too. Not again!!"
24,"a free write: leave a story, leave a comment- on schedule edition.","This is a "" Project "" i ' ve started and hit writer's block with very early on. It's called tube girl. Hope it's alright if i just post it as comments here: * * part 1: awake * * he awoke feeling... Strong but also that something was very, very, * very * wrong. Of course he felt clumsy; 43 % of his body was new he picked up the envelope on the table labeled: ' * you * ' inside was a list which he scanned to get the most: * bones: metal alloy * bones & joints: equally upgraded * right arm: replaced what was left at the shoulder. * not a toy. * * *: replaced. Output increased steadily. * vascular: blood not sufficient. New fluid is gold. * vision: permanently corrected. * payment: soon to be collected. Gold - stained bandage covered the spot on his chest with difficulty, he put on the clothes provided to cover the rest."
25,The species have started to become lethal. Physical contact with the opposite sex is considered worse than even sex.,"Day 134: those who spent more than a week in the opposite's company immediately before sunrise are dying like flies. The long - terms and marrieds had their own section of life, but it was only a matter of time before death took hold of them. The others were expecting it sooner, but i don't think that matters now. It all happened so quickly. First it was the news reports, people had red eyes and severe chest pain. Then there was the health warnings, to stay away from the workplace for fear of a condition that had turned into symptoms like swelling and bleeding from the ears and nose. Suddenly, people in dark suits were patrolling streets, entering homes and pulling people away from the police. We became numbers, "" Us versus them "" and in time, mere mention of it had you landed in isolation. It didn't take long to change the language syntax. Men became "" mates "" in a matter of weeks, relationship status began to define survival."
26,She always started feeling it when she was two landings down.,"She was pissed off, again. They knew it was a problem with her. She couldn't help it. She 'd been raised to finish what she started. But they constantly scheduled her for just start of these long flights. But she had an ace in the hole, this time. She 'd gotten her certifications, and she was commander on all her flights from now on. Whenever she had two more landings than landings, she began to feel anxiety. The feeling that she wasn't coming back this time because she 'd left something alone. Like forgetting to put up the landing gear, or raise the flap after takeoff."
27,"It turns out that when you die, your soul is launched back in time, effectively becoming your own guardian angel.","Right before the blast of bright light i saw those i love crushed like dust. Time meant nothing and everything became dark. A slight pressure on my eyelids awoke me to a hooded figure sitting across from me. I blinked rapidly as i studied the presence across the room. Sitting in darkness surrounded by what only seemed like miles of an ocean of black a solitary light illuminated my dark friend. He stood up silently and vanished into the curtain of darkness that hung around him. As i watched confused and silent i stumbled over to the chair to take a seat. Instantly my mind began swimming and irked and tried trying to hold on to my conscious thought. In an instant i was back, back to a familiar place. I watched as they left the room and the side of the cabin to crawl into a deep sleep, a feeling i no longer understood."
28,The most powerful spell ever forged.,"Simon was not a murderer. He didn't bend the universe to his will or offer anything more than the occasional word in the name of good reason. He was a clever youth, though, and that would soon change the fate of all mankind. At the start of school, Simon's village required of him a test, the same given to those wishing to join the elder ranks. The caves of Mount Everest hosted many a foul creature. The type of beast Slain would decide the path of those that returned. Not all did. Two years prior, Simon's friend Liana had returned with a baby; she now learned to inherit the farm. When Thomas Kindrel came back bearing a hammer, he ascended to become a farmer. Simon was limited in skills as a hunter. When he ventured to the mountain caves, he was armed with a mind larger than his dagger."
29,""" You may have one wish granted. "" "" i want all my debts cleared. "" "" how much do you owe? "" "" you mean. My debts are not monetary. ""","Gehenna left the room, her prize in hand. As thieves went, she was second to none. She covered her head and began walking. The gate was long closed by now and the courtyard, normally filled with merchants and goods and noise, was simply a wide open expanse covered in sand. Reaching the inn, she went around, to where the ropes were tied. Careful not to disturb the sleeping animals, she climbed the nearby tree and entered her room through the open window. Safely back inside, she shut the window and lit a lamp. She took out the ring she 'd found in the closet and studied it in the light before putting it ring on her finger. She turned it clockwise, and read aloud the inscription. She saw nothing. "" Why -- "" "" i am the keeper of the ring. """
30,You ' ve been invited to a dead man 's party.,"The invitation had arrived in a sleek, metallic black envelope that i was reluctant to open, wary for reasons unknown. It was left forgotten for a week until i was cleaning my counter top off and i decided to open it. My pocket knife was slipped out of my pocket and the tip of the blade barely separated the holes that kept it closed. I dumped the contents of the card out surprised to see a tissue like card embroidered gleaming with silver. The writing, written in silver also, said: dear Mr. Nicholas William Susick of North Jameswood, Virginia, we formally invite you to the party of Mr. Jonathan Thomas Smith of south Jameswood, Virigina. Please arrive in formal attire at 5 pm on Tuesday, October 11th, 2016. We ask that you do not bring a guest. Hello, Mr and Mrs. Jonathan Thomas Smith of South Jamesford, Virginia my hands shook.

Dexter Morgan pulled a hood over his head and climbed down from the cab. "" You mean? "" a dark haired man walked his way, his black vest shining in the moonlight. He offered her his hand. "" i ' m fine. That's a nice rig you got here man, what's wrong with her? "" the red and yellow fortune - drive sign illuminated the dark lot. Several trucks and bikes were lined up out front. "" yeah, she's a beauty. """

Only problem is that your future self is a huge asshole.","I had a bad feelIng about thIs. It felt almost lIke cheatIng, but on the other hand, It would make Life so much easIer.

33,"Your grandparents always playfully joked in their native language. To surprised them, you took lessons, but now you understand what they're really saying...","I rang my grandmother's bell. I visited them often, in their little ranch - style house. Someone had to. They were my dad's parents but he didn't visit them much. He called them the most vicious, bitter people he had the pleasure of knowing. And my mother? Still afraid of them. But they had always been nice to me, their only child. Alway's remembering to bring me presents on my birthday, much to my parent's dismay. They had been a part of my life and so, a couple days a month, i would come over and cook for them. I had recently graduated from business school, an education which they had partially financed and had gained employment at a popular place not to far down the road. Today was different though and i waited in anticipation."
34,A small child awoke from being nearly dead screaming that it was empty and nobody was there. Soon similar stories spread from across the world and the truth slowly emerges; there is nobody left in Heaven.,"As the electrocardigram failed, my vision faded to black. Not in the same way as when you fall asleep, everything went black, my sight, my hearing, i couldn't even smell the gasoline soaked clothes i had crashed my motorcycle in anymore. I felt like i was falling backwards into an ocean of eternal darkness. But i was still perfectly conscious. I not only could feel, but i sensed the absolute lack of anything around me. I was claustrophobic and yet in a wide open space. I tried to scream out, but not even an echo replied. I was totally alone inside myself. I was floating in the darkness of darkness. Then i saw a light."
35,"You possess the rare gift to see and talk to dead people, and have kept this hidden from everyone your entire life, including your spouse. Now your spouse dies and is quite surprised.","Marc took a few days to show up. They usually do. I don't know where they go in the interim; neither do they. I ' ve asked enough of them. They don't know where they go after, either. I 'd like to think there's a heaven. I doubt it, though. Either way, all i know is what they tell me. The spirits of the dead, that is. They ' ve told me they feel a pull -- some feel it stronger than others -- that forces them to leave our realm. The realm of the living."
36,A new drug let 's you live a lifetime in one dream.,"It was bound to happen. I mean, just statistically. I woke up today, and there was an incredibly familiar flood of thoughts and memories in my head. I didn't notice it at first. Nobody wakes up and goes "" What a wonderful morning! time to check my memories to see if they're consistent and i don't have Amnesia! "" you just assume it's another ordinary morning. But then, i tried to remember what i did last night, and the day i reconstructed was yesterday. It didn't seem to fit. I kept going about my day, but i kept thinking about it. The more i thought about it, the deeper i dug into the swirling pages of what should have been a simple practice of recall, the stranger things appeared."

"" yes, you can check it up on my business records. "" Jacob replied. "" excellent. You may have wondered, for some time, why there was so much secrecy surrounding the base.

38,"Aliens have arrived, and ask for a single human to hear humanity's case and save them from extinction. The human is selected through a lottery of the entire human race, and on the day of the drawing, your name is picked.","I ' m not especially smart. Maybe that's why everyone seems to hate me. My job, of course, was one that required someone especially smart. Someone like Winston Churchill's third nephew or Abraham Lincoln's half ancestor. But they chose me. Wasn't my fault, being chosen. I mean, shit, i didn't even apply for the job. I applied for almost 20 jobs over the summer and the one that chooses me was the one job in the whole God - damned universe that i didn't even want. I got a call back from someone as well, but they were just trying to give me advice on what to say. So many people trying to give me advice on what to say."
39,Two people promise their first born child to two different witches in return for a favour. These two people end up getting married and have a child together.,"When they arrived, most of the villagers had retired for the night. A few of the more daring peasant children, though, had crept out of their homes to see what they could under the light of a full moon's second hour. There were a few small groups who made a custom of these things. Occasionally they caught sight of a spirit or ghost -- or, more often, one of them * claimed * that she had. But this night they would be rewarded with a sight none of them had seen before. They hid in places around the entrance of the village, waiting and hoping but not expecting much. When the first shadow passed them, they were not sure what it was. When the second did, they knew.

Even the brain is secondary to the heart, the heart can survive without the brain, but the brain is doomed without the heart pumping life into it. It just never made sense to me for her to finish with the heart. Why did she do it that way? maybe i was a unique case, maybe i was the only one who got his heart last. I, somehow, remember when she finished. I could already sense her there, i could see her beauty despite my eyes still being closed, i could hear her humming softly with dead energy, i could smell the sweet scent perfume that she wore as she worked on the finishing touches.

I spent the day working at the clinic, after all. It was my job, my duty, right?"
53,Madness of today's outpost - the contest.,"This was an interesting idea. I liked the time period for this story and i liked the setting of this story. I also liked Paul's character and his insanity. I even liked that he displayed his madness so readily to Jaron - it really showed to me that he wasn't in touch with reality. Somebody with even a little bit of sanity would probably be more hesitant to reveal that he's hurting people. I see that you were pretty close to the deadline, so i ' m glad you made the word count. Still, if you decide to believe this story it would be helped by simply being longer. I think talking more about Xavier's methods ( especially with Jaron ) and his intentions would be interesting. The mass suicide really seemed like the start of something bigger and more important, so i was definitely intrigued to learn more there. In any case, i ' m no expert - but i certainly enjoyed the story. Good luck!"

It was the same tumor that did for it, and whilst i was recovering, i was visited by a woman in red. She worked for the agency, she said, and she explained that she needed to see me at home when i 'd recovered.

I ' m fairly certain that history will report that the cats were the first earth beings to be contacted by the dark ones.

He could wake up his younger siblings but that would come with a price of its own. While his siblings were temporarily entertaining and not too annoying in the mornings, they still required supervision. He opens his laptop and goes on reading. He scanned through the pages again periodically but overall he was still bored. He rolls his eyes and grins; it was still only morning he would have to suffer the entire rest of the day with his body. Aaron laughs and his hand accidentally slides across the keyboard. When he looks up, he realizes that he accidentally clicked something and rolls up the page to see where he was reading. He was still on it but now he was on some strange subject that he had never heard of: writing poems. He looks at the top photos and looks them interested."

Devon ’ s chest heaved as his breathing began to slow. All around him, passing strangers had stopped, keeping their distance, waiting for more soldiers to arrive. Who could blame them? state education stated that magic users were rare and dangerous, but magic users were also incredibly rare; all the citizens were watching instead of running. Helten barely acknowledged their presence. He just stood in the center of the street, blue and purple energy pulsing through his arms and out his fingers, magic power only recently discovered and now burning for release. But Helten contained his new power, at least for now. Soon, the crowd began to part to allow a man on horseback, followed by two dozen guards, to approach the magic user. The man on horseback looked down at Helten with a smile."

Everyone knew it was coming, everyone could feel it radiating through every atom of their bodies, the whole world collectively too close to the sound of a great concert. She had been dancing enthusiastically up until this moment started, and so many people had reacted the way she had, dancing with Abandon to the ever increasing beat and abandoning their day to day tasks. It was infectious and inevitable! and why not? who knew what would happen when the great drop finally arrived! but the rest was dead because the music was stuck, hovering over that sweet relief from the ever pounding pre - drop. At first it seemed like it would come any second. That second extended into hours. Into days.

Everyone seemed perfectly happy to let us ' discover ' a place where people already were- despite knowing that he used maps to get there ( and badly at that ) - but now that we had two asteroid belts, that had to be addressed! my irritation must have shown on my face, because a few people gave me a bit of distance. It was fine by me. I was only in here to get a drink and check the scores. A crawl on the bottom mentioned the few bits of time that had escaped orbit, and made the distance to ( against all odds, and three years later ) coincide with earth.

The small bell on his collar had been little defense against the recent night terror. Joe briefly considered recruiting some alley cats to his neighborhood. As it was there weren't enough cats in the area. The mercenaries typically stayed in the downtown areas of the cities, living off of the lack of humans and what little payment the local cats could afford them. To get some into the suburbs one would have to come up with more food somehow. Jingles would have to give up part of his own savings to pay them. The others were closer now, their shadowy figures peering past the trees."

The few remaining safe places became safe for humanity in a world more terrifying than we ever imagined. However, in true post - conflict fashion, it was proven that man is the real monster. Where governments failed and religions proved useless, one thing remained to keep people together. The inevitable power vacuum was filled by a group so vast that it covered continents. The truth? the knights themselves? the evil ones? no. It was me. Feeding into people's unique needs for food and shelter ( as well as entertainment and cleaning supplies ) allowed the corporation to drive its competitors into the jaws of the hideous creatures lurking outside their walls.

My husband was off on business again. I knew that's all they were, business trips. Nothing changed. Nothing like i was trying to do. My would - have - been lover broke up with me tonight, via a text message of all things. I knew from the very start it was wrong to feel for him what i did, especially when my husband had always been so supportive of me, of my depression and panic episodes and irrational behavior."

Every time i ' m there, i keep thinking about the tracks. It would be fucked, wouldn't it, to force that on someone. I would take a step forwards and fall, and the wheels would run over the tracks and bite me like an artery. The driver would see, in slow motion too quick to stop, a human being falling in front of their train. The other passengers would see the blood. They 'd hear whatever sound a human body makes being crushed into pieces. A thing like that could take someone for life.

Typical girl, staring, but looking away whenever i turn my head. Why can't they just come out and ask? life hasn't been easy. My first memories are cursing this red dragon birthmark, which everyone assumed was a sign of power and destiny. Back then i was too tired to admit otherwise, going off the sea dragons and destroy undead without even being asked, because it was clearly expected of me. No more. I try to enjoy my drink... We down wine in a cold glass, but can only focus on the murmur of conversation behind me. I know they're talking about it, trying to work up the nerve to ask me, the ' brave champion ' to save them from the dangers to the west. Those things.

150,A single person appears in the real world.,"The creek flooded the walking path today. I take the path to get to school. Usually, the creek barely covers its bed. But sometimes it does. It makes sense when there's a reason. But sometimes storms don't cause the creek to flood at all, or the creek only floods during dry spells. There hasn't been any rain for the last month, but the creek flooded the path today anyway. I pushed through the flooded section of the path, and continued to school. I passed by the cotton fields.

He told us of the wars and destruction in the forbidden zone. Everyone outside of our wonderful country is inflicted with a disease where people lose their humanity.

A normal place, if normal was still normal, with people of all shapes and sizes, all races and styles, surrounded me. I was sitting at a tiny round table, a cup of those fancy little glasses hooked loosely between my right middle and index fingers as it rested on the hard polished wood below. The scent was... Oaky, along with a mix of coffee and fresh bread. Very real. Very typical. "" Do you see? "" a voiced asked from inside my head. "" i see.

This made me feel much better about what i was about to do. I opened the car door, and pulled her body out and sat her up on the sidewalk, being careful not to look in her eyes. The eyes would always bring me back. Something about staring at someone's blank eyes just makes you realize that time is stopped."

Make the audience sympathetic to his / her cause.","The old man watched from above as the men lifted the hero on their shoulders and marched him through the streets. A proud, confident smile shone from the hero's face. He had every right to be so proud and confident, the old man supposed; he had just slain the dragon of the earth. And of course, this was after he personally fought back and defeated the cursed ones, which was after he killed the great body of the rock. Indeed, he had earned this celebration. The gods again would sing their songs, praise his name, honor his victories and praise him in legend. Soon, they would ask him to be their leader, their Lord, their ruler. Why shouldn't they? he alone stood up to the mortal danger that threatened the town and he alone saved their lives on several occasions. The hero did by himself what no other single person could do."
205,""" I need you to understand something before i kill you. ""","The first sensation was a burning in my hip that ran up by back and to my spine. I opened my eyes and one was still dark, burning with the iron of my own blood, already swollen shut. Breathing in, my left side twitched, holding the breath. Ribs were broken. I exhaled and pointed my chin to the sky. A calm settled. There was a hand on my shoulder, pressing me down -- - i felt the gravel cut into my knees. A metallic voice filled my ears. "" I need you to understand something before i kill you. "" i sucked in a sharp breath, remembering the fight. They had sealed themselves in the floor of a hold filled with refugees, keeping us from meeting them till the attack started. After the initial forces rose up outside the walls, those in the refugee transport emerged, scattering all before them."

I can see the bee hovering over the flower next to the stream behind him. I can count the beat of its wings, the movement of its tongue as it licked up water. If i so desired, i could tally the pile of pollen stuck on its leg. I can see the flow of air around us, the gentle motion of the breeze as it clashes with the fierce force a storm still impending. Yet, and yet, he has the ability to claim that i will not see a single one of his swings. What a good plan. I can see how strongly he draws his sword, the shift of his clothes as he stretches and shifts his weight."

It was trying to break out, to explode into the world. Nothing could prepare everyone for what was next. If you're lost, the best way to explain this is from the beginning. David was a nice boy from Brooklyn who enjoyed normal 80's activities for 10 year old boys of which i know none of, maybe playing with kid's or riding penny boards, or wearing tiny shorts or something. And he loved being a kid, until one awful day he was abducted in the middle of the night. To his avail this wasn't an ordinary situation, yes that day David was abducted by the gods of rock. He had previously listened to some Beatles and other popular rock artists of the past decades but music was something David ultimately dismissed as he lived through the 1980's doing 1980's things. After this night everything changed for David Draiman of disturbed."
210,The ocean is a scary thing to you. But you made a promise to a friend.,"The smell of the salt was enough to feel me with satisfaction. The arrival, all it did was add to the tension. The salt breeze had a way of bringing back all my past memories. But i smiled. I had made a promise to a friend. Sand. I remembered, randomly, Hayden christensen's infamous line. A smile briefly danced across my face, replaced quickly by my own scowl. Huh, a scowl- never had thought of myself as a scowl - er. Hadn't even... But there was no use dragging up old memories, especially now that i was ankle deep in the sand that was less sand and more rock, mostly rocks that floated on my feet. All the movies had made it seem like bringing shoes was a bad idea, it seems they were wrong. I knelt, and scooped up the coarse sand, and let it spill through my fingers."

Take it from the point of view of a nature documentary.,"We will leave the mating process of the alpha male be for a moment as we return to the weaker male of this tribe. Although he has been stalking his prey for quite some time now, his efforts have been unsuccessful. As the boy prepares himself for taking in a female for the fifth time, he decides to take a different approach. Where at first he tried to mimic the alpha's approach, dressing like the pack, changing their speech patterns and manner of movement. He now tries to be himself. He prepares for one final stalk before he attacks. Now this might seem abstract but he's finding another female to have a conversation with about his prey. The other female got the bait and is now talking in rivers about the snake's prey. Here we see something common with weaker males, when they ' ve gathered enough information about their prey and think they ' ve found enough matching interests they will feel confident enough to start their attack. And so the boy starts his attack."
212,"As the sole it guy who went to Hell, you are the one tasked with fixing Satan's computer.","It... Was an option, Jeff supposed. For hell, it could be worse. It was pretty hot, of course, but Jeff had a little demon who followed him with a personal air conditioning and a fan. There were regular torture periods each day, even though "" Day "" was really a magical concept here, but it was little more than a light beating and an almost pleasant day in the lake of eternal lava. He got as much food as he could eat, and even managed to score a beer off a willing devil once in a while. The idea of having a specialized skill set down here. Were it not for * him *, Jeff concluded, this might well be considered a subset of Heaven. "" Jeff. "" the voice carried through the entire plane of existence.

Not in a threatening way, but in a way that made me think he was more focused on something else, something i couldn't know about. It always seemed like he was only half there when i talked to him, and eventually i stopped trying to make conversation. I didn't expect to be invited to his house, and when i was, it felt like i was about to be let in on something. Little did i know. I arrived at his house at almost dark, and it certainly didn't help. The house looked almost exactly like a haunted house, like something designed to scare children. In German. The really weird thing was, though, that it seemed genuine in a way that i didn't understand. Like it just made sense. It was almost nothing, really."
214,Heroes and artists take over the world after everyone is given orders based on imagination.,"Not to say things were pretty insane when it first started. Imaginary friends becoming much less imaginary were the first to start appearing, but soon artists and writers from all over began developing various abilities, some generated raw emotion, some changed the very fabric of small pockets of reality and some shaped certain events. I gained some power to be sure. A lot of my characters started appearing around me, several of which started fighting. After that i managed to affect the rules of the universe near by. But by no means did i have a lot of power. Most of what i did was shelter those that barely changed at all. Creating small pieces wasn't very easy, and hiding others was a simple task. They would be fine for my entire lifetime as long as i wanted them to be. Of course, it wasn't long before most non - humans were either killed, enslaved or hidden, and several of the most important were children, but they were much too raw."

His was the only face i could remember so clearly, so perfectly to rival even a photograph, because i had seen it every waking hour of my life. Sometimes he would just stare, stood dead centre of my view, sometimes he would occupy himself in my presence. I witnessed him eating, or perhaps praying, on numerous occasions. At first, i was scared beyond measure, children do not react well to strangers, but then i realised he was completely right. An ever present entity, never aging, never changing, simply being. He would move to avoid my touch, turn away to make speech, and simply disappear amongst crowds. The long nose, strong jaw, green eyes - an odd shade of green - and defined cheeks gave the figure a look of nobility, a king perhaps. But his skin, a shade of brown darkened by years of work in the sun, suggested otherwise."

It stretched for as long as she could see, the lights radiating a white light. People were afraid of darkness where she came from. It was said to influence the minds of the healthy, twisting them into dark creatures. Long ago, her people had raised walls around their country, lighting up every single corner. Villages were protected by large, elite forces holding glowing weapons. Roads protected by patrols and patrols connected villages to the large central city known as Lumitopia, a beacon of light that could be seen from wherever you were. If you were ever lost in the darkness, the beacon served as a guide to bring you home. Once long ago, a village in the southern part of the country went dark."

He would walk, no, * stalk * through the halls, styled in his peculiar combination of rubber gloves, an apron, and a shirt, and his glasses would shine as they neared light. He wasn't attractive. At least, no one was attracted to him, despite his good looks. They disliked him for his * personality *. An artist, a scholar, and a gentleman in the middle of a conservative American small town is not exactly a recipe for romance. The popular girls would give him the cold shoulder, the boys would yell at him from across the hall, and anyone decent enough to show him a little mercy would be seriously arrested for it. It didn't matter, though. He didn't care about the latest gossip about so - and - so or the next big football game. Because he was special."

He said that here, the cold would ride on your chest and time would do the same, freeze in a thick white blanket of snow. My grandfather on the other hand would tell me that God was an artist, and that our world was his canvas. He said the purity of the snow was a lesson. Everything has an inherent promise, and sometimes there just aren't lips to speak them. To me the snow - capped peaks of these mountains were fingernails that were grasping for the sky. Our little valley was held between a giant ’ s hands. I imagined him lifting us high and away from civilization. His straining and heaving causing the winds and forcing the clouds to fall to the earth. However hopeless, he would push us closer and closer; until even he, could no longer reach."

When we come out of the cave, they can't hold back gasps of excitement at the sight of two tall people, wrapped not in fur but in soft robes; feet in boots, not hides tied with vines.

The king closed his eyes as one particularly ugly blade brought the axe back down upon his head with a crash. He awoke. That in itself surprised the king. He was further surprised to find himself not in the dungeon or even clasped in chains, but wearing his usual robes in the town square. If his lack of captivity surprised him, he was not stunned to find no ominous face, no sinister prison. There was, in fact, not a single implement of torture to be seen. There was, however, a large and strangely silent crowd surrounding him."

I told myself, upon the discovery of it, that i would take advantage of the writing of thread as often as i could. The task is easier said than done.

"" i turn my head and take in the large window before me. It scales from ground to ceiling, with visible remnants of original decorations and window paint."

This had never really bothered me - it was just normal. So every few years we would get together, check up on each other, and so forth. We were both procrastinators so these visits were always short and intense. Well, there we were in Christmas eve in a Chinese restaurant outside of Dc.

Most of us lived at the feet of the gods and sustained ourselves as merchants, traders, tight knit groups of farmers, and most prominently as fishermen.

There were only three left in the side pocket of his backpack - last time he 'd checked, there had been a couple more. Kids were curious.

Even the stairs stretching up and out of the station were left vacant, shoes hadn't touched them in years now. * what happened to the world? * i wondered. Long ago i had noticed the number of my passengers decreasing as the world grew smaller, until finally they stopped showing up completely. I never stopped coming here though.

She would be an alien, if pain and effort was given to wipe away her identity and give a new one. Super human - all the comic book heroes. War was done much differently now.

Finally, they spoke at length at a mutual friends apartment. They were separate from that moment. One or the other would sneak into the kitchen late at night.

The most recent defensive measures seemed utterly ineffective against its slow yet determined advance across the globe. It quickly became less a question of whether you would catch it, and more a question of when. That was when the focus switched from prevention to damage control.

He was the one who stayed dead the longest: 46 days, but i 'n't get into that. The only thing we don't know for sure is what's beyond that threshold. Do you go into a dream state? how is our perception of time affected while you're out? is it like dreams where it feels like hours and days but it's only been seconds? is it just nothing?"

Though the spirits are unified by their ability to manipulate sleeping minds, many of them had chosen to abandon the “ old ways ” of the elders. The elders are determined by nature. Consuming a man ’ s soul through his dreams did not appeal to the spirits among them.

Mistaken for dreams of fantasy and legend, spirits begin their weaving of magic and manipulation through appearing as mythical beasts. Elders, as self - proclaimed gods, identify as dragons. No other spirit may do so, of course. This would be one of. As the elders died in the hours of dusk, their younger counterparts lay in wait.

The commander scowled at the data as it splashed his face in an artificial blue light. His worst fear had been realized.

Further examination of the data revealed that during the faster - than - light transit the ship had passed incredibly close to a s - type red giant. Solar radiation had overcome the artificial magnetic field of the mercury and fried all electronics. This would have killed the crew; however, the new mercury's engines were to the aft of the shuttle and as such protected by a secondary shield. The primary ship, charged with protecting life support, crew quarters, and command, had held off the radiation."

He had been persuaded into trying nod by a friend, using the term loosely, and was already beginning to regret his decision.

In college, i tried my hardest not to think about the numbers. As everyone around me achieved higher numbers, mine stayed the same."

Dust floated by in the sunlight filtering through the smoked glass window on the wall. The handle was hard and easy to grab, but slippery underneath his clumsy hands. He looked up.

He coughed. The miserable air around him echoed with the sound."

He did. On his desk, two or three phones were ringing. He didn't care. He knew what was happening. The United States of America were on the verge of destruction. He hadn't see it coming. Not on this scale. The threats from the police had been addressed too lightly. And now, he had to deal with the consequence.

A lot of his job, honestly, is sitting around waiting for these little guys to get home already. People who aren't in the business don't understand how boring it can be. If he had to describe it to someone, which he never would, he would describe it as being like a lava lamp exploding. Sometimes, you can hear the glass cracking before everything goes boom, but there's really only 1 second where anything exciting happens. But there's a terribly long wait for things to heat up, and there's such an endless clean up afterward, if it takes you by surprise. Really, one has to be a * saint * to be an assassin.

Before it had so much as risen into the upper atmosphere, i had melted myself into liquid metal and escaped through a window. "" Please, everyone! "" a deep voice at the front of the bus called. I reformed into my usual police officer shape and pulled out my pistol. "" i knew i should have stayed home today! "" a tiny red - haired kid said. After snapping his neck, the other kids cleared out of the aisle so i could get to my target."
1436,"Joe, the villain.","In reality, i learned it from my dad. Or maybe it is intrinsic to my personality. But it started after Ma left and dad took to spending his evenings living up to the name brand la - z boy while angled towards the television, a baseball game flickering quietly, forever on the seventh inning stretch. His home business went up in smoke. I couldn't blame him, either, maybe that's why i kept looking up to him. Ma, in contrast, was a terrible person. She 'd take and take from dad, his money, friends, happiness, you name it, and i still remember the row they got in when he came downstairs to find her looking through his wallet. For the tenth time. Yet, dad cried like a baby when, after preaching conservation and education one too many times, she packed up and left without a blink of a made - up eye.

He died within seconds. The machine hissed as it powered down. The smell of burnt flesh came pouring out of the booth, soft, yet strong enough to make a few of the witnesses gag a little. He was a skilled slaughter host, he maintained his composure easily. "" This man has made sacrifice. Theus, please step forward. """

I picked up the child, cradled her in my arms, and only then did it occur to me that my mother had known it was a girl. She might be wrong, i considered, but i didn't want to check.

His hand connected with its tiny scaled body, and it landed in a crumpled heap in some litter before shaking its head and flying into the distance. James had always thought dragons to be powerful creatures that inspired awe in him. Until they fucking arrived. Three years ago ' the rift ' opened above the continent and thousands of the tiny little bastards flew out. Nasa was smart, the Cia couldn't control them and those was had a field day. Earth thought it was on the verge of a great war, or a revolution in the way we lived our very lives.

Then she had realized that the change came from outside the church! it had taken a millennium, but it seemed that humanity was slowly creating its own code of ethics, rather than using the Lord of Heaven ’ s.

Dozens of scientists from a wide variety of backgrounds and countries gathered around the giant screen, holding their breaths and clutching their fists with anxious anticipation. Typing away at the keyboard, a young man executed the final command needed to trigger a rapid reaction of self - improvement cycles. He then stepped away with a flourish, gesturing at the screen to display the progress. The tension in the air grew thicker when an awkward silence took over. The reaction didn't start. The screen remained static, displaying the same values every time it flashed. The young programmer looked at his colleagues, then back at the screen, and finally bit the nail on his thumb with a worried expression. Reaching the keyboard with a shaking head, he looked upwards when he heard a buzzing noise. His jaw dropped until his mouth formed a wide grin."

They had sought to save the people of this last, great human city through the genetic weapons they so desperately needed to survive. He had broken them. They had sought to halt the civil uprising that swelled up on a wave of economic freedom. He had broken them. Finally, they had sought to stop * him *.

Anyone who wishes the same thing as another person will result in death for both.,"Jonathan listened intently to the voice that spoke to him, as it simultaneously spoke to everyone on the planet. He hadn't been too interested at first. Why would he? a weapon would be of no use to him; it wouldn't fix anything. Anyone who thought a superhero would improve their lives was a damn person, especially if they didn't get the required secondary powers to make them work. But then he heard the scream. If he 'd been a dog, his ears would ' ve picked up, even though the sound seemed to be playing directly in his mind, and not in the world. If he wished for the same power as someone else, they would both die. * * ten … * * Jon Groaned and looked at the pile of vomit he was lying in. * * nine … * * this could work. * * eight … * * he wouldn't have to worry about the rope snapping, or not finding a vein, or, as with his most recent attempt, missing the lethal dose."

Walls were streaked with dirt in a mixture of varying colors -- brown being the most dominant -- and a strong stench of urine, and Musk lingered inside the unventilated dining hall of the restaurant. He staggered in pain, and clasped his hands, food covered tray to his chest as a child would a stuffed animal. This was a mistake. He was innocent, of course. But then again, his word had just as much value as any of the inmates here.

1633,Defending her honor.,"The room was nicely furnished, the walls covered in a dark stained paint and littered with numerous portraits and landscapes. A fire flickered in the hearth, more a token of light than a source of warmth. Numerous servants fluttered in and out of the space, their hands full of fresh flowers or clean linen. One of them, carrying a silver tea tray, set it down in front of faithr and gave a little. Faith thanked her, and the maid smiled and left. "" What? would you care a cup?

I miss her kind nature and her matter of fact approach to life. All the shit that was handed to her she greeted with utter acceptance and dignity. I just miss her asking how my day was.

The chanting that had at one point echoed through the hall had died into a whisper. I gazed into the mirror, and was met with my own piercing eyes staring back at me. Or rather, through me. The demon at the gates had promised to show me my soul, the one that i would fall in love with. And all that stood before me was my own form. A shiver ran down my spine.

She wiped her eyes with the sleeve of her apron and mouths the word “ please ” once again. This is getting boring, so trivial. She has no idea that she is dealing with a monster. I am mine, though crafted from human flesh. I raise my powerful hand and she nods slightly, her fear is wine to my very mouth."

He walked into view in the street beneath me. I ' m not going to pay him much mind.

1756,You hear a polite knock on the door. The closet door.,"Despite Tom's preference for sleeping like a newborn, the familiar sound of the knock, in a somewhat familiar fashion, woke him in near blinding rage. He was no stranger to this sound, as these bizarre incidents had been going on for weeks, and he had no explanation for it. This time, however, he vowed it would be the last. "" Please don't make a face this time, dear. "" he heard from his wife. She kept her eyes closed, eager to fall back asleep before the pain kept her up. "" don't worry, honey, this 'n't take long. "" Tom said, grabbing the 9 mm from his underwear drawer. He crept over and swung open the door, revealing a vast, empty landscape. In normal circumstances, this would seem absurd, but Tom was no stranger to this, as his eyes and trigger Finger promptly met between the eyes of the weird half Goat man standing in the doorway."
1757,A new drug let 's you live a lifetime in one dream.,"They never could have stopped me. While the politicians and companies argued and the media went mad over it, i was calculating the possibilities. The drug didn't have a name, not officially, but went by a thousand names on the streets. I didn't care what they called it. An entire lifetime, burned into a short span of brain neural activity, and then you came out the other end. That was the trick. They never realized the potential, not until it was too late. The arrangements were simple enough, for me. The system to supply a constant dose of the drug and to keep me alive while i was under was child's play. After it was set in place, it took nothing more than a few hired hands to supply the substance itself."

Light peeked through the horizon, as it always had, and always would. * prepare. We hunt. * * soon. Death! freedom! * the anticipation was incredible. She trembled with it, as she crouched there among the trees, holding her bone spear. She closed her eyes, remembering of a time when her people had enslaved the shadows. Those had been good years. For centuries, the rich bounty of the lands had belonged to the people. Blessed as they were, none of the people could enter the building, but the shadows had been their faithful servants, and they brought the rare resources back."

A loaded pistol rests on the dresser next to him.,"The silver blade was poised like a beautiful star. Loaded, like a bird ready for flight, and elegant, it's slender muzzle extending like a bird's neck, ready to catch it's prey. It was waiting. Silently, it rested on the old wooden table, gleaming against the black material, like a candle in the darkness. I remember the day, twenty years ago, when that woman brought it in- the table, that is. It was a tribute to the old days, a witness to the eternal summers me and her had spent, the times spent joking, springs spent playfully, and solemn winters. It had witnessed us move in, fight, break up, and our unconditional love for our daughter. Now, the wood appeared darker than ever, the only light being the gun it nestled. Another round of pounding shuddered the door, but this time, one of the pins gave loose. Time was almost up. I spent a long time opening the door."

The next morning while eating breakfast you realize that everything you touch turns into milk chocolate and begin to panic since today is a very important day.,"I stood next to her in front of the large oak door of her parent's home, waiting for her to knock. She had been looking at me intently for nearly a full minute. "" Why are you being so awkward? "" she finally asked. "" just knock! "" "" my wrist hurts! "" i blurted out. She paused and turned slowly to face me fully. "" your... Wrist hurts? too much to knock on a door? "" "" Hey, "" i said, holding my hands straight out at an angle that i knew looked ridiculous. Even getting to this point had been an absolute nightmare. It had started with a loud alarm, followed by a chocolate clock."
1763,Escape from New York.,"It's not the people that kill you. Not the bullets or the bats or knives. It's the silence. That hopeless depression that crept into your very core. That's why i like to keep a pistol, safety off, at all times. Just in case one of the others tries to stir up the mood with a suicide. I ' ve gotten good at guns out of hands at this point. Of course, that ruins their gun, but it's worth it to keep them alive. Not that we're really alive anymore. The virus is taking it's course in all of us, changing our body to metal."
1764,A man who thinks he's a hero realizes he's the villain. What is he thinking?,"It wasn't that hard. He was exactly where they said he 'd be, and the so called "" Resistance "" amounted to four poorly trained boys that couldn't shoot for shit. Two months ago the first whispers in nearly ten years of his whereabouts made their way to the ears of some higher - ups. Three separate agents were able to confirm the validity of the claims, and a surveillance had been established. He never left his compound. Two workers were constantly not gardening on the property, more just standing around, and two house workers who carried a lot of cleaning equipment came and went in turns. There was a woman and a boy, who was estimated to be around ten years old, who would visit everyday. Someone chose that. There was some significance, but it wasn't communicated to me. I had my orders. My men had been "" my men "" for the past seven years."
1765,"Your son did as your will said and gave you a big funeral because you thought it sounds cool. Beyond, a smiling ghost yells at you for doing so and gives you a weapon. Good luck, Steve. It's going to be a long time.","The weapon shakes and spins, filling the air with a pure metallic ring. As i watch the weapon glide directly towards me, i am suddenly overwhelmed by a soul - shaking roar that forced all of my hair to rise in unison. As i pull my eyes away from the sword, i notice a figure charging towards me with menacing steps. My breaths tremble and race and my mind flashes red as inatch up the sword near my feet. A flash of steel, a harsh blow, and a piercing clash. My sister narrowly misses me as i dash away to create some distance. The man raised his sword, his leg muscles easily guiding his sword into a slow dance. He was a mountain of a man: his muscles burned and threatened to rip his clothing apart. He wore a magnificent beard underneath the plain mask that concealed most of his face. He lets out a roar and charges again."
1766,"Two victims of bullying make a plan to shoot up their high school together. However, they both secretly plan to betray the other in order to become a hero.","I don ’ t know why Jerry considered doing this. He always seemed like a nice kid. Straight a student, captain of the basketball team, volunteered a lot outside of school. It didn ’ t add up to me. The kid had absolutely everything going on, including his pick of the girls. There was a rumor he had so many girls ask him to the fall dance that they created a formal submission process. And we ’ re talking like * the girls * too, everybody who was a somebody asked out jerry. Even a few girls ended relationships just for a chance at a date with him.

They are quite right but people seem to only focus on the bad. I have lived for centuries and i have experienced just as many happy moments as i did sad ones. I think the key to it is to have a goal. A man can never truly live life if he doesn't have goal. Sadly, the more normal goal of ' stay alive and have a happy life ' can not apply to me any more so i have had to find other goals. Some of my goals were noble but done through ill means. Some of the goals had been entirely selfish, and led me to being called a great man. Others had been to solve problems for others."

He sees a couple coming toward him in matching suits...","Everyone has a story inside them. It ’ s human nature to be a soldier. I am a collector of stories, but i ’ m also a narrator.

He takes long strides with a coffee in his hand. His eyes are always dark as if he can ’ t believe that he ’ s still working the same job for the same pay.

He could do whatever he wanted and they never seemed to care. Most of the time they weren't around. When they were they just told us to have those microwave meals and "" Take care of ourselves "" like we were adults too. My mom never let me have those microwave meals, she said they were bad for you, and she was always begging me to do my homework. Not like Dan's parents, we could do whatever we wanted there. I remember when we would make pretend armies and wage war for control of the carpet kingdom. The cans were our infantry, the small bottles were the cavalry and the bigger bottles were the artillery. We would have huge armies and fight over the whole house, from one end of the carpet to the other. Today his parents had let him set up a swing in their house."

Brian was afraid to get too close to this particular point in space, for fear that it would destroy him."
1771,"He had no arms or legs. He could n't hear, see, or speak. This is how he led a nation.","The lands were dark, and the people poor. Slavery bought the world, the rich ruling the poor. Wars erupted, blood bathing every inch of the nation. People lost hope, gave in, leaving the throne open. Through this open throne, they suffered. Through this open throne, he was born. He grew, his kindness unlike any other, suffering the same as his kin. He brought light in the time where the sun didn't rise. He lifted the spirits of his brothers, giving them the strength to fight back. Blood turned copper, drying upon the dirt, the green finally flowing, pointing to the sky."

I waited for about ten minutes and when i woke up i was a little tired, so i got out of my bed, walked over the dirty clothes on the floor, and opened my door. On my way to the kitchen i got the sudden urge to talk to someone. My phone had died earlier and i left my car at work, so i was alone. * maybe i should talk to myself, * i thought.

You're the first person to receive a dragon...","Sue always got a cat; she wore that over us for weeks, as if a cat was the best sort of animal there was, and not the best of Egomania. Mark Johnson got a better job. He spent the whole week working; then again, that's what he always does. His parents were cruel, meaning to be kind. When my time came, the first thing i noticed was the size of the box on the lawn. I couldn't just help thinking of stories of parents gone mad, acquiring kids when none would have died, or that girl two towns over who was killed by her father. They put the beast down, but she never got another. She hadn't been an animal person in the first place, unlike her parents. Me, i ' m not at all like my parents. They're... Common. I am not."

The soft call that mother always had when she called him down from his room to take a walk outside. The reassuring attitude that his father always carried around with him. David felt brave back then.

I knew immediately i was in for it when the guy walked in, and instead of seeing his face i saw twenty different faces of people i knew. He pulled a pistol and leveled it at my chest. Raising my hands above my head, i mentally wondered why we didn't invest in some sort of currency - holding technology that wasn't * literally * a fucking cash register. At this point, getting robbed was part of the job. "" Money in the bag, asshole! "" he violently threw a plastic bag at me.

The times i ' ve wanted this. How old was i when it first popped in my mind. Eight, probably. It wasn't serious back then. My mom had taken my arm, and i just kept hitting my head against the wall, wanting to faint, but not being able to. I stopped, when my mother came in, and wrapped her arms around me, and hold me tightly. I relaxed. And it was quiet. Of course i didn't want to die. I just wanted to make my mom happy.

You are the only person in the world with no shadow.","I used to have a shadow. Tall, strong, a warrior. Like those crazy guys on the sides of those cars in the museums. I never really saw anyone else have a shadow like mine. Many people make friends with similar shadows, like dog owners in parks. When i was in college, my professor said there hadn't been a shadow in the book like mine since they invented one. Anyone with that shadow tended to go at the speed of a hundred and twenty meters per second. Said the old shadows sometimes pop up. Said a shadow like mine wouldn't do good in the army. Guns wouldn't be the same for me, in the deepest parts of my heart."

They explored the intricate tunnels and caves in their back yard, and played among the frogs and whippoorwills along the nearby stream. Phoebe always led their little adventures. She would dash down the river bank and leap onto the rocks, while you never broke the current. They would climb the tallest trees while he lingered on the lower branches careful never to over - reach his grasp. Then they grew old enough to inherit the family business.

I texted her back asking, "" I can't find you, are you hiding from me? "" i waited patiently for a response. The digital clock on the nightstand next to our brightly colored bed illuminated the otherwise dark room with a bright blue light. The clock separating the four numbers blinking every second, adding and taking light as it pleased. After waiting twenty minutes, the ridiculous notion that i might not be in our home crawled inside of my mind and made camp. I walked outside to see if i was indeed inside of our house, despite my key working on the locks and the inside of the house looking identical to what we had in our home. Sure enough, the house was the same as the one we bought together six years ago when she got a job in the city."
1805,Make me feel as paranoid as possible.,I am the same. I wait and see how these things behave. They are the dominant species but their intelligence is not inherited. Every off spring must replace it or it becomes indistinguishable from the rest of the creatures on this planet. They surround themselves with artificial things they make. Big things that are primitive static and small things that are nothing more than colorful tools. Without many of these things they would create more advanced tools that could help them against me. But many of these things just distract them. Their shells are fragile. Both their moving things and the things that control the moving things can be broken with just a touch.

The moon - as they were called, sticking to the shadows and consuming the light, the hope, the joy. With them, came disease, despair and hatred. The champions fed on the power of the lady, growing stronger and more powerful the more light they consumed. The blood - elves were no match for their even our least light Fed champions. The soul - worms were forced back to the pits that spawned them. Not even the shadows could play host to them anymore."

I was home, running my own non - business, putting off all of the stuff i was supposed to do. I mean, why do anything productive when you can really manage.... I don't know why i ' m telling you this, what's important is that it was a pretty standard day for me. It all started when i left my house. I had ran out of energy. At the time, i had thought it impossible, but things we're about to get worse. I hopped in my 1997 red neon, and continued my drive to my local hotel. On the way there i felt a little strange in a way that was hard to describe, like my mind was spinning every few seconds. My thoughts seemed to be a second or two behind."

Tools. That was the thing that elevated humanity from mere beasts. And these celestials... They didn't have the drive to craft anything. A demon would be unlikely to use a blade, an angel would never mine for the steel of their weapons. They simply created their creations from the air. Which meant they didn't necessarily * understand * the properties of their tools.

People was saying that it is God himself coming down to prepare earth for salvation. Others was saying the complete opposite, that the devil was coming to torture all them wicked folks.

The boss likes them that way, says that it makes them more interesting. Maybe it's part of that “ free will ” deal. I wouldn't know. Anyway — i reached out and summoned my supervisor, asfaraghanquanimonumel, and he marched into my office in great blazing heat until i coughed a couple of times and he changed down into a more human - compatible form.

What clothes that touches your skin snaps and burns, forcing the fiery heat within to stay where it connected. Beginning to gasp through your breathing, you set the pipe beside empty bottles and cough. They had said it was strong, promising through grins that the high would last the night. Truth or lie, the alcohol assured it would. The last few hits had made the drumming of your heartbeat into an aching that went from throat to throat, beating each with every beat.

He is a good man who will provide for her and treat her well. With regard to the supplies that you sent along earlier, they were snatched by fire before they could reach me. Even so, the thought is kind. You may remember Lawrence Grigg from one of my previous letters about his career in the field at Inkermann. It is with great regret that i must tell you that he turned to disease. He is the third man from his unit to die from the sickness in the last week. It is a terrible shame to see such fine fighting men given away to an unseen enemy. I now think myself able to adequately answer Father ’ s question about the American soldier, and i can write with certainty that he does not appear to be as arrogant or evil as the times claims."

He gave me an unappreciative stare as he shook off my touches and moved nearer to the other children. His induction was today, the first of may. As the laws required, every child who reached the age of ten in the month of April would need to attend their induction today. He looked so mature but small with his hair styled and wearing his suit fresh from the war. I couldn't help but frown and smile at the same time, imagining his entry into the club. My own wedding was fifteen years ago, but the preparation and threats from my parents carved the entire experience into my mind. Fear drove the beast. Your greatest fear became your greatest power, either the power to stop your fear, or the power to expand your fear, usually to force it on others. I supposed both were able to help you overcome your fear, but neither were looked upon more kindly than others."

He would stick his tongue out at me occasionally. He would sometimes break into coughing fits in which he shoved his fingers down his throat in an attempt to make himself vomit on the floor.

I figured $ 10 would cover everything."

Just a month ago he was heading to the coast to escape the winter cold, now he was in a volcano and all he wanted was some chill air. Lava flowed from the cave floor. It dripped off into ice, swirling in a pool of fire before steaming into nothing. “ a fucking dragon, ” Jake chuckled and stood on shaky knees. He counted two broken ribs on himself. It brought his month long count to sixteen. The dragon ’ s roar echoed inside the volcano, making it sound like it was coming from all directions. Jack grimaced and braced himself. Unlike the stories, dragons were surprisingly quiet creatures, roaring only before attacking."
1836,"Aliens have abducted you in a random sampling of men, women and children.

The room is dark. My eyes adjust quickly. I see three walls and metal bars on the fourth side … i ’ m in a prison. Weak, coarse voices are heard all around. The sound of coughing echoes through the room and into the large metal hallway just a few feet away from the metal bars of the prison cell. The ground, the walls, and the bars all seem to be made of the same material. A cold draft comes in from the hallway when i realize that i am naked. I look around, and i realize that the other dozen humans in my prison cell are also naked. A sudden chill runs down my spine at the thought of that, and i curl up in a sitting, relaxed position."

I couldn't explain them to anyone while i was younger, my parents thought i was just insane, my friends thought i was insane. But as i grew older, i realized that i could explain the dreams if i only gave proof of their authenticity. This realization in itself was a mistake. The first person i told, i saw on a train, about to be blown to bits. When i saw them in the waking world, i warned them about their future. They didn't believe me, and died as a result. The second person i told, i saw them on a roof, about to jump. I warned them about their future, and a day later i saw a news story about a man jumping from a roof.

1839,Tell me the story of a publicly hated hero fighting a much beloved man.,"The arena had been standing or 20 - something odd years, but finally, it was being used - "" Time "" isn't really a concept to celestial beings. The arena was designed much like a therm, but bigger - large enough to hold nearly ten million people. Millions more would be watching it from their homes; it would be broadcast in nearly every language, shown on every channel. Today, Satan, champion of humanity and God, the divine father and creator, would duke it out, in style. I was lucky enough to land a gig as a musician here, to witness the big event. In the stands were people, mostly with tiny light - up red horns purchased from a dollar store, some with red and black face paint. The former academic in me wanted to smile; still buying into the medieval portrayal of humanity's champion? it didn't sit well with me. I saw him, earlier today.

All she ever did with her weekends was spend countless hours reading the internet for girls generation, or arguing with random strangers about who was the best looking member of it. If she was going to spend her day here in the internet world of art, they argued, then she might as well try to get a glimpse of a real one anyway. Apparently, big Bang was coming to life. Somehow, she had missed that. Her green eyed friends did not. So here she was, in the midst of dozens of teenage girls, at the airport waiting for them. It was 6: 00 am, she was freezing cold and these girls would not stop screaming. They weren't even here yet for Pete's sake.

For what are we if not hungry for the loss of self that takes place in a well - crafted life? given this knowledge, i would prefer to break the mold of meta, and instead rely on layered characters and smoothly developing plot lines that call to the heart. Heart is, of course, subjective. In all my readings, it has meant something different to each author and each character. Just as i can separate my love of story from my love of family by the simple rhythms of mine, others should be able to see the depths of an author ’ s heart and understand the beat."

Without smell, i could see like a hawk, and oh god the food. You have not lived until you have tried one with your taste and turned up three hundred percent! you can get through life without smell just fine. Then i tried touch. Just for a few moments at a time, whenever i wanted to, it was like looking through a telescope, and being able to distinguish every sound around me no matter the surrounding noise. It was like being human. Tasting your own skin like a wine was less painful, so taste went out the window to. I regretted that sometimes."
1846,The scientific investigation of records has dramatically changed how courts enforce multiple life sentences.,"I know i ' m late for the exam, but i couldn't get around to writing for it until a few hours ago.

1853,Divided we stand. United we fall.,"It had been a belief since the earliest human civilization, if not farther back. The belief was that if we all believed in the same thing, whether it be the same ideology, same leader, same civilization, same God, same culture, that would lead to peace. That difference built tension and thus war. But near the middle of the 21st century, it began to be realized as reality. The nations of peace were more about democracy, ideas, and diversity. International cooperation wasn't done because we were sharing beliefs, but because we had something to drive us towards learning about one another. The seeds of compassion were rooted in learning about each other. It's when we already knew, we became open to it. This was the origin of religion. It wasn't that we feared the different, it was because we were so used to the same."

Beta was in perfect form, her hips swayed back and forth as she slid through the shadows of the corridor. Alpha linked her optical interface into beta's so she could get an improved view of the alien ship. She followed the two soldiers into the ship and delta followed behind her, covering their rear. Alpha didn't trust rear security to a delta, and especially to this delta, she was dumb even by delta standards. This was also her first real mission and alpha didn't know what to expect.

I ' ve tried to cut myself, jump off of buildings, run ( which don't even work ) and i ' m still here. I ' ve done terrible things to some people in their frozen state. I ' ve set up old enemies so that they will fall into the depths of hawaii's secrets, i ' ve had sex with countless people, and even made a Jenga statue out of thousands of statues in China. I am jealous of Bill Murray's character in one day."
1916,You are the last person to die and go to Heaven. Humans have created a way to extend life indefinitely. You meet with God. He 's not happy.,""" The fuck mate? yer a right man aren't ya? "" God looked at poor Chad. "" now tell me how in the fuck you mates right figured out how not to die now? "" the cannon like voice continued. Chad was sitting in his chair. He had been a generous and nice fellow all along, even if he was a bit crazy here and there. He felt slightly confused and yet still amazed to have God talking to him like he was some sort of deity. He turned his head up towards God's face to respond to him. The only problem was that his creator's face was too astonishingly bright to make out. He 'd always wondered if God would look like Tom Jones but to his dismay there was no way to confirm this."
1917,Bob ross was actually a serial killer that painted where he buried his victims. His paintings are becoming suspicious and the body count is rising.,"The latest episode was starting. Mark sat at the television, watching, waiting. Bob came on screen, like he always did. The smile he gave the world once seemed warm and kindly to him, but Mark could now only see the inner smile in his teeth, the way his eyes shifted around in their socket, the idea of somebody getting away with murder. It had occurred to mark that he may have gone mad. But therapy could wait. He was onto something. He knew it. “ hello, and welcome to another episode of the joy of painting. Now today we're going to try something a little different, but don't worry - ” mark nodded to himself at the line, eyes drifting over to the walls of his home. They were covered in photographs, pictures from the show, some from behind the scenes."
1918,Blatant magic vs. Subtle magic.,"At one end of the room, a teacher whispered into another girl ’ s ear. Her expression transformed from worry to fury, green eyes narrowing. Those were the eyes that held more power than anyone else in the room, evident with brilliant streaks of gold. At the other end of the room, a man strolled past. Black suit wrinkled as he moved loosely, carefully. As one could tell, he was a very bold and brave man. Dark hair pale against pale skin. He had the look of a guilty man, one who had done wrong but took pride in it. Eyes connected across the room with a spark. One set was smiling, the other screaming."
1919,"A person's eye colour relates to what colour they have, activated at age 18. You are the first person to be born with totally black eyes.","I never had much luck at bars. Even with beer glasses on, most men tend to be terrified by pitch black eyes. I ' m a pretty gal, and smart to boot, but my eyes are certainly off putting to most. No blue Eyed Beaus ever tried to seduce me with any parlor tricks. No brown eyed girls ever try to fool me with some skills like weapons or strength. No green eyes try to impress me with their incredible beauty or sheer strength. But its not like it ever bothered me. Never in recorded history has there been a person with black eyes. All other colors are well known and researched. All of the variations of all of the known colors have been thoroughly documented, but to everyone i remain a mystery."
1920,"You have a special power which allows you to see a bar above everyone's head which shows how much of their life a person has lived. One day, you decide to go out with your friend to dinner. His bar reads: 99. 99 %",""" The chicken here, some beans and some juice please "", he ordered. 99. 99 % shone brightly over his head. There was no changing what was about to happen, what happens happens. Dan was anti - induced and seizure. Even the smell of death could kill him. I thought it was a little ridiculous. The plates arrived at the table. I quickly snatched up the keys - these are a serious choking hazard! "" hey what gives? share those! "" he exclaimed. Just then, he had a massive stroke and went face first into the potato bear."
1921,You missed the last person leaving earth.,"I ' m briefly disappointed when i find out the truth. "" The last part? "" i say to the door. "" really? No, but i always wanted to go on one. Really, the last one? "" the part — her name is nuala, according to her head — nods. "" yeah. I ' m sorry about that. "" i sigh and look at the line behind me. It doesn't really show from here — the view is restricted by the many buildings of the huge part of San Francisco — but there are thousands of people in line behind me, and millions of people scattered all over the world, still waiting in line. But i ' m not scared for my life; if anything, a little depressed, because i ' ve always wanted to ride a train. "" but the rockets fly equally well, and can store more people, "" nuala says, pointing to the fleet of rockets at this platform of the station."
1922,The story of a serial killer who prey only on the strongest.,"There he was, two - hundred and fifty pounds of sweat - slicked - ridden muscle. The need came in strong and quick pulses. I could almost taste the experience, the feeling of being alive. It was dark out tonight. Cold and blue, the sky was littered with glaring stars. Everything had to happen quick and hard and fast, or it 'd be no fun. My reflection in his shiny pick - up told me everything i knew. It didn't matter that i looked bad, acted bad, dressed in black, dressed like a man, or even if i carried a fucking hammer because guys like him didn't fear guys like me. Guys like me, big and tall and thin and blond, walked with long strides that said pretty boy, handsome devil, and murderer, but never serial killer. I didn't even carry a hammer tonight, so of course he didn't run."
1923,"You are the owner of a small restaurant that is struggling to stay open. Suddenly, your restaurant is on the front page of the newspaper.","I stared at the newspaper at my feet. "" What the heck is this? "" on the front page is a picture of my restaurant, in black and white. I pick it up and start reading the article. * * to make a difference * * before all of this, i was homeless, i have enough courage to say that much. My life was a mess, i lost everything because of my addiction, my home, my friends, my dignity. The way people see me and talk to me is always a simple look, never looking me in the eyes. I smelled and look dirty with old sweat and a short beard. But everything changed when an old man in a suit, approached me with a kind hearted smile. He passed me a total of $ 1000. "" sir, this is far too much, i can not take this money. """
1924,""" I ' m your God now. ""","I who am i? i am. You are you. Who says so? i do. Who am i? i am. I am here and you are there. I will inevitably take you to me, and you will never return. They will say, "" The others are no good. They are evil. "" they will find them."
1925,You find a small box with a red button while walking in the woods. You push the button. What happens?,"Red roses, red hats, red buttons, red stripes, red flags. Red, the signal of shit ’ s going down. There ’ s this red button. A red button in the middle of the woods. A red button housed in a silver box. There ’ s no picture, no icon, no scratched in it, just a perfectly shiny silver box and a perfectly shiny large red polycarbonate button. What the fuck. I ’ m not an ordinary person. I don ’ Trot, bird, pick flowers, talk to girls, kick pinecones or care one way or other about the seasons. It ’ s hot, it ’ s cold, it ’ s humid, whatever, i like it cool, seventy - three mother fucking degrees, the toilet nearby, the fridge even closer, my computer on. It ’ s called evolution, folks. I like it."
1926,"For decades you have worked and fought for various evil villains / enemies and the occasional hero, and surprisingly survived till retirement. Now in your teenage years, you open a school to educate and train future companions / villains on how to not die.","Rule # 1: do not, under any circumstances, fight fair. Rule # 2: if you can shoot the hero in the back, do it. See rule # 1. Rule # 3: if the hero is surrounded, do not allow him to defeat you one - by - one while the rest of the group dances around again. Rule # 4: if the hero is facing overwhelming opposition and is smiling, do not engage. He almost certainly has a secret weapon. Rule # 5: do not approach the hero with the intention of going to get your boss. Just kill him. Rule # 6: if the hero has a weak idea for comic relief, the poor side should be killed along with the hero. Plucky ladies have a nasty habit of rising to the occasion. Rule # 7: if the hero offers to engage in a battle of wit, just kill him."
1927,"Describe a physical object. At the same time, use it to tell a story.","The key dangling from her neck by a thin chain. The chain was gold laced over a cheap metal - alloy that made the bracelet more affordable for teenagers. Near the bottom of the chain, where the lock hung, some of the gold lining had worn off revealing the cheap metal beneath. Over time the dull gray had turned to the reddish brown of ash. The woman grabbed the key and slid it slowly along the chain. It was a nervous habit. She started to climb the stairs. The exterior of the house was inscribed with a golden star from the Harry Potter Series. The wings of the bird were outstretched like a bird in flight. Originally tiny inscribed lines had given fine details to the feathers of the wings, but over time the details had been lost."
1928,"Your entire life has theme music. Every day up until now it has been sweet and melodic, today you wake up and it is sad and ominous.","My hand, almost of its own invention, swings over to hit the alarm clock. * Fuck! * Oh! did it again. Same spot too. The red veins in my eyes are the only indication of the stress i ' ve been under lately. Why should anyone else know? it 'n't make them happy knowing that i ' m not. The skin on my arm rose a bit. I sit up, looking at the empty spot on my nightstand where the alarm used to be. Don't need it any more. Every morning, without fail, at * exactly * 6: 45 a. M., the music starts."
1929,"Alien body states come to invade earth, but losing a human body is challenging.","We are the same! we descend on a world, we turn the strength of the enemy against them, we battle them with their own might. The stronger they are, the harder they fall. We are the last, and this planet is our next meal. The alpha troop descends on the strongest of nations in this planet, filled with the strongest specimens. We take control of them, then the conquest begins. Bilateral symmetry, Bipedal, two arms, one head. Nothing we never seen before. Open eyes of host. We have visual stimuli. Test motor functions."
1930,""" I was burned, burned, poisoned and thrown into a river. But not in that order. ""","I begin to eat on a small family farm in search of a little bounty for my empty stomach. I am optimistic this would be the place in which i find relief. I come closer to the low light setting to find a family surrounding the warmth of a fire. The livestock begin to stir in discomfort at the signs of an unwanted visitor. I continue past in assurance that a meal lie in wait. Before i am able to survey the surrounding area i feel an intense pressure followed by severe pain on my spine. I swing around to see who or what was performing an assault on me. I connect eyes with a man, one of the same seeking warmth around the fire. In a silent shock, i turn around attempting to escape the mistake i made by coming here. Another eternal second passed and yet again another blow hits me just behind the head rendering me virtually useless."
1931,"Write the most horrible character possible, then kill them in the most natural way.","She never saw herself the way i saw her. God, was she beautiful. In a broken way, she was so beautiful. She had been used, criticized, beaten down, and made to believe she was worthless. She was ashamed of who she was yet she was so painfully honest. She was afraid of being rejected for the mistakes she had made but those never mattered to me. I knew that she was scared. She had been through a lot before i found her and she was terrified of getting close to someone again. I don't know what i did to deserve it, but she opened up to me. She shared with me her fears and desires along with her deepest dreams and aspirations."
1932,A man is secretly in love with his sister. He begins to bald.,"You get a lot for twenty dollars and a tip. Happened last time or so. I was new in town and the wife was starting to make comments about the hair so i went out looking for a date. Found one, and didn't think too much of it, made sure and sat down in the chair he directed me to. But there's something oddly intimate about getting your hair cut isn't there. As he first raised my hair to comb he must ' ve activated some sort of strange energy up there because i realized that i was in love. With him! or something like that. And i kept going to the same place. Started to develop a romance with him, got to know him better. Father of two kids apparently."
1933,Write a story where each sentence has one more word than the last.,"* hi. * you again? * how are you * hope you are bad. * i hope you love me. * because you must love me, right? * you smile at me, you hug me. * that is not siblings like love, you fool. * that is the kind of mom and daddy love. * but who am i kidding right, because you and me. * funny; you, me; seems like a dream to one of us. * but why do not dream about us together in the dream world."
1934,"It's new years eve. Your best friend died in college, you ' ve been robbed twice, your girl friend is leaving you, you ' ve just lost your job and the only one left to talk to is a gay girl you ' ve got tied up in the kitchen. P. S. Your cat is dead.",""" So this is it, eh? "" i said to the man bound by ropes on the floor. No answer. I washed my hands again. I ' ve always thought a man should be measured by two things: the love from his closest who keep him company, and his own personal life. At least i have one of those going for me. I spoke again, this time almost literally. "" happy new year, too. "" thinking back, it seems everything that could go wrong had so this year. Alan, who had been my best friend for years, always greeting me with a smile, had died this summer. Olivia, the beautiful woman i ' ve had the privilege of sharing my life with for almost four years started packing her bags just the other day."
1935,"Write a horror story with no gore or death, not even implied.","I was walking to the bus a couple of weeks ago when i saw something metallic on the ground. I picked it up. It was a ring, a weird beat - up metal band with this little bald head sort of engraved on one side. It was just such a weird object. I thought to myself, who would have made something like this? why would anyone ever wear it? what kind of a statement are you trying to make wearing this type of jewelry? that Doesn ’ T really make any sense. I ’ ll try to describe the ring a little better. It couldn ’ T have been more than a quarter inch thick, and it ’ s not like the face was drawn in with too much detail."
1936,"You and your wife wear rings that let you feel each other 's heartbeat. Your wife dies and is buried with the ring on, and you always wear the ring in memorial to her. One day the ring turns on again. ..","I looked outside the window of the warm living room again, watching as light rain fell from slate grey skies. My finger pulsed quickly with the heartbeat of the woman -- Linda -- sitting across from me. A woman i had not met until today. I glanced at the gold and black ring, remembering seeing it online years ago and buying it for my wife and i. A way to always be reminded of each other. A way to always feel the other's fast beating heart when we stared into each other's eyes. A way to feel each other's heart when we were a thousand miles away. But one day, ten years ago, the pulsing stopped. She had worn it throughout the treatment. I kept it on as well, even as her spikes and nails against me."
1937,Lava ruins.,"They call themselves the Hunters. They were demons once, not even that, demonic beasts, barely bred and bred for war by the undead gods. Now they are something else, something between people and monsters. And in the desert lands, on the slopes and in the valleys of the higher peaks they built a home for themselves amongst the mortal races. With their foul magic, they turned the land to ash and the skies into storms. Yes or no, the remaining princes of Veluka did not care. Their neighbor across the desert would sell strange spices and metals mined beneath the higher peaks, in return for slaves from across the world. Not for labor though, as breeding stock, to use their old blood before they turned to new monsters. They say the dead are warriors, facing a constant war, but nobody quite knows who on. Not their neighbors, who steer clear of them. Who, then?"
1938,I could see it in their hooded glances and practiced smiles.,""" Hey, Adam. "" that familiar tone of voice fills my stomach with that cold, empty feeling of anxiety. * oh no, * i think, * she's here *. Last week was quite possibly the most uncomfortable shift of my life. It started like any other - chaotic, chaotic, messy - and calmed to the steady, almost relaxing dinner rush, all within a half hour of my arrival. She was working - sitting about to each of her five tables - as she normally does every day, but that night, there was something different about her. Her posture was a little lighter, her hair a little darker, her makeup a little heavier. Normally a single change would not have caught my eye, but the combination seemed to have a profound effect on the way she reacted with others. She was a woman on a mission. And her mission was me."
1939,Becoming a god.,"I was sitting in class when it happened. It was a particularly dull chemistry period, and i was staring at my teacher, her Jones with something halfway between horror and hatred. He was going on about chemical bonds and i remember thinking to myself that i wished that he just didn't exist. With a pop, he vanished. Everyone in the class bolted upright suddenly, shocked out of their hot summer afternoon of stare at the spectacle of a teacher vanished into thin air. I was shocked too. People were crying, and Mary Thomson started to scream. The noise was ear - splitting and i pushed my hands to my ears, silently wishing that she, too, would shut up and just watch. Yeah, you see where this is going. The problem was that the more i did it, the more people started to scream and cry and run around in circles."
1940,Every alien species in the universe receives a Jesus figure from God. It turns out humanity was the only species to torture and kill him. You're an ambassador priest informing the inter - racial holy church what your species did.,"Word to wise, this is my first time. I ' m working on improving my writing skill. The pope waved his hands uncomfortably the entire flight. Mere weeks ago, earth had received an off world transmission, the first in decades. It had been returned immediately to the Un, and was then passed on to the police. Apparently some alien race was trying to land in Washington, Dc, and required earth's “ top religious leader. ” the British had insisted they would be landing unarmed, but many, the United States especially, were on edge. Pope Francis glanced out the window, noticing the Jut of land that had to be the east coast of the us. A few turbulent minutes later, and the jet was setting down on a private airfield outside the town. As the pope stepped off, he was immediately rushed by waves of all manner of people; news reporters, government officials, politicians."
1941,"You ' ve been trapped in a "" modern day "" style loop for years. After your most destructive loop yet, you stop trying.","It was fun at first. Well, that's not quite true. After i initially realized that i was in the loop, i was terrified out of my mind. I went about the long day in the same manner as i had before, hoping against hope that it was just a dream from which i would soon awake. I didn't do much anything different, because i was scared that just when i did something wrong, something evil, the loop would end. As the days dragged on, though, i began to relax. The initial terror and hopelessness wore off by the end of the first week, and i began to get bored. I started looking for something to keep me occupied. For a while, honestly, i pretty much just sat and watched Netflix all day, every day. I ordered piles upon piles of pizza, ordered whatever food i wanted, in fact, because i knew that i 'd just get all of my money back the next day."
1942,How to make a perfect butter and jam sandwich.,"On first glance, it's just a sandwich. Ordinary, plain white and square, sat perfectly on the plate. From factory to supermarket to kitchen, it has lived mostly a short and non - residential existence. But it is not * just * a plain sandwich. It is clearly more. What goes into a sandwich? not just foods, spreads and cuts and the like, but tastes and ideas and even little sensations that keep you up late into the night. The sandwich - maker, then, is not simply an amateur expert. They are in fact a philosopher and a romantic artist. The bread, their canvas; the knife, their brush; the melted butter and all their paint; and the final sandwich borne of their flowing, fertile water."
1943,You have discovered a time machine. Instead of going back in time to kill him you decide to stop the murder of Biggie himself. Only to discover that the person in the other car is thers from a future that hasn't happened.,"* i used to read word up magazine * * salt n ' pepper, heavy d up in the morning * i had my phone in. The pavement was cracked and bruised. I had been listening to a lot of music lately; somehow he knew me better than anyone. He pulled himself up with his own story. He went from selling crack on the streets to being a killer. I kept on searching life after death, searching for something i hadn't seen in it before. Every time, something new came up. The walk from school to the park was long. I listened to everyday struggle and kept wondering what would have happened if Biggie hadn't died. His murder was a tragedy, and as much as i loved him, if it turned out his label was behind it i don't think i could ever forgive him."
1944,You find a slot machine that gives a random number for a day.,"That dusty slot machine actually worked - i just had n't known it at first. It seemed like it did nothing but eat quarters, until on that very same day, i stumbled but did n't land on the hard ground. I was floating. I flew all day and all night. I ca n't wait until that one comes back around, if it cycles that way. I 'd tried to fly the next day but ended up with a couple of scraped knees instead. I tried the slot machine again - and again i got nothing. The lever on the side did n't make the wheels with pictures on them spin. But i could feel a warm sensation in my knees. When i looked down, my knees were n't scraped anymore! i knew i could never let anyone know about this."
1945,"You come home after a long day at work, shower and eat. You get into bed and start sleeping, but as you roll over, you feel someone 's in the bed with you. You live alone.","Susan locked the front door of her apartment and slid out of her heels. She was so glad to finally be home from such a great day at the office. Her feet hurt, her hands hurt, and her head hurt. All she wanted was some quick mac and cheese and a nice long sleep. After putting a container in the microwave she looked around her home. Something about it looked a little off. She Couldn ’ T place her finger on what it was, but there was for sure something different. The placement of furniture seemed to have changed some, and she Didn ’ t remember buying any beer. She placed her hand on her head and massage her temples. Work really was starting to get to her, but that ’ s what exhaustion will do to someone."
1946,""" You know what? fuck this war. I just want you dead. """,""" You know what? fuck this war. I just want you dead. "" i said, taking the gun from my hand and pointing it at her head. "" go ahead. Kill me. You're standing there, your gun pointed at my head, while i sit on the floor in the corner. You want me to beg for my life or something? because it's not going to happen. The only one who will sob over my death is you. "" she spat from her position on the ground. Judging from the way she was sitting, she probably had one broken leg and at least three broken ribs. She had a cut on her lip and eyebrow. "" why would i, of all people, cry over your death? "" i asked, walking closer to her. "" Unless you forgot, i ' m the only one who knows where your beloved son is. You kill me and she dies. "" "" tell me where she is! """
1947,"Everyone knew what would soon happen in that room. Everyone, save for one man.","The tension was gone. Assassins, mercenaries and drug lords sat grouped around a circular table. Every shadowy organisation or criminal empire in the world sat beneath a temporary truce. A truce that was, as fate would have it, about to break. Violence was imminent and they all knew it. All of them, that was, save one. "" Alright then, hi - ya. "" the man quickly signed his signature across the last sheet before closing the heavy folder. He slid it across the table with a polite smile. "" everything looks to be in order but why don't you take some time to review it while i handle Mr Mikhailov's request. """
1948,""" You will feel what she feels, live when she lives, and die when she dies. ""","All i ever did was scream. For years i floated through life. Too lost in imagination, in a life that i was going to lead, what the future would bring. I lived a happy life, but was happier still when i was lost in those thoughts. I don't remember exactly the first time we met, just that within a month i couldn't imagine not knowing her, it seemed crazy that we 'd gone years without each other. When we were together, we never wanted to part, she didn't say it, i didn't say it, we knew. However many nights and days could have passed and i would have been happy just lying by her side. Really we just ended up constantly late to work but that was worth it too. Now i just sink through life, waiting to reach its ocean floor. All i ever do is remember."
1949,You 're bored so decide to have a conversation with yourself.,"He couldn't remember when they had put him in the room. Time had gotten soft; he thought it was less than a year, more than a month. The walls and floor were smooth and white. The whole ceiling glowed from within and seemed to pulse so slowly it had taken hours to notice. "" Fuck. "" the first word he had said since he entered, his voice rusty from inside. * "" the hell's wrong with you? "" * a voice answered. The man nodded and stood up from the floor. "" who said that?

This phone was one of the few that had a universal translator attached to it. * let's hope it works, * i thought as the line came alive. "" You ready? "" Dr. Kidd said from my right. I nodded, shaking. The ringing in the fireplace transformed into a waiting tone. * Good *... Doot... Doot... * on the fifth ring the alien picked up."
1951,"When a new president is elected, they are given a special security rating. In reality, this is an old tradition where various directors, military officers and current ministers present fake evidence and compete to see who can convince the president of the most ridiculous things.","The alert popped up on general Gerald Paxton's computer monitor. * 15 minutes until next meeting * he casually clicked ' off ' to buy a few more minutes to close his eyes and relax. This wasn't just any meeting, it was the meeting. The meeting to brief the new president on all issues related to national security - both foreign and domestic. At least, that was what the media and the rest of the world believed. Regardless of the number of times he has been part of these meetings, Gerald knew they would never get any less personal. The sounds of knuckles tapping on the old oak door removed all hope of any peace before the storm. Before Gerald could invite his guest in, a woman already made her way to the center of the office. "" Yes, please come in Prime minister "" Gerald said with a hint of sarcasm and a smirk on his face. "" i bloody well will ' come in ' where ever i please! """
1952,You die and and welcomed into the future but first you must design the future that you use for the rest of eternity. Describe the creation process.,"I have to design an answer. My first thought is to question whether the future will have a similar physical world to the world i believe i came from. Will there be trees? will there be time? will i be able to summon fire of absolute energy in order to destroy anything within perception which i choose to destroy? my second thought is to question if i could be influenced by the world? should i be a floating blue - white sphere which sees the world in third - person? i consider my current situation. I can not enter or begin the story until i have designed my plan. I essentially have unlimited time to do this, -assuming that my welcome into the world isn't temporary or conditional."

Everybody told me to look forward to getting called, but the anxiety is overwhelming. The yellow envelope the lady gave me has been sitting across the table, but i just can't open it. My whole future lies within, completely out of my control. Just the thought of that terrified me. I ' ve been told that people with terrible power are taken away, a few people have come on the news and spoken about it now. They ' ve all gone missing now too, to me that's enough evidence. I need to know though, i need to know who i am. So much time has gone by waiting for this moment, and i ' ve grown tired of dealing with the headache and nausea."

It was 10: 45 a. M., so he had about ten minutes. An hour ago he was just off the surface of the moon, attempting to see the fleet of spacecraft that were threatening earth. Even if he took out a ship per minute, there was no way that he could speak of all of the crafts prior to them reaching firing range. He accepted the fate of the world and went to be with those he loved. The cemetery was empty on the crisp January morning. No one came on this, the last of days, to pay their final respects.

I tried to change the events leading up the crash, but it happened every time. Even when i befriended the prince, when i killed him - another arose from the ranks. I tried to get him to crash into another person on the same date - nothing. For all i tried, my life still ended, probably at the hands of a drunk driver.

Thousands of life lessons learned, experiences ranging from extreme poverty to abundant wealth, lives lived in poor comfort and in absolute terror. All the memories across a million different landscapes come flooding in. The time you get survival out of a desert. Swimming in the icy waters of a pond. Running your hand across a wave of golden grain. Standing on the moon and looking back at the pale blue dot that was earth. You are all of them at the same time, every emotion, want, fear, lust, love, joy, tear, happiness, all as one. You laugh and laugh, thrilled at having lived so much.

Even the elves closest to him on the council would not be able to ignore a slave ring. It was almost sad how quickly they had turned on him.

It wasn't the business of the other races ( oh no, he even had something of a thing for the more elegant ones ). It wasn't the fact he had to carry around a translator, to interpret the various patterns of flashing light that were used as communication. It wasn't the fact it was impossible to talk to somebody until you were acknowledged. Oh no, his complaint was much more... Practical. You see, they were the only folks that ever figured out how to translate air signals into nerve signals. In other words, every other race in the galaxy was deaf. Which meant they had no concept of sound. Which meant they had no concept of noise. This Davis hated explaining, again and again, why he doesn't like hanging around the high - pitched hiss of an engine in action."

It popped into existence as if it had always been there, we just weren't seeing it. We had no clue what kind of technology could make that possible. We analyzed the transmission and the only thing our scientists could seem to agree on was that the information delivery seemed too mechanical to be manually generated. We were talking to a machine. Every nation received the transmission in a perfectly structured rendition of their native language. The signal was precisely the same, it just interpreted differently. It made no sense. The message itself was clear in its intent."

1975,"You 're an aspiring photographer, but every photo you take ends up being used as a missing person picture.","The first three were mostly considered an extremely unlikely coincidence.

The asphalt was stained with it, half - burnt and tire tracks dragged through it. Cigarette smoke drifted on the cold air, their lit tips glowing in the dim light. It was pointless, hanging around here after our shifts were over, but there was some need for communal bonding keeping us here, co - workers who knew next to nothing about each other. A reminder that we were not alone in our lives. "" they must be trying to meet some sort of quota, "" Kev said, sitting on the hood of his car, his eyes closed. "" everyone's fucking worn out. Hey.

When i am trusted, expose the religious order's secrets. They will not stop me, for they believe my order exists.

Its part of some competition and can't be shown to the public. Anyway, it was an honor and i wished him well. He made a lot of changes and i loved where he took it, it probably helps that i ' m not a control freak.
