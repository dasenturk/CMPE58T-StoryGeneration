 It must have been 40 years ago. 
 He remembered on that early fall day. 
 He remembered heaving that huge leather jacket that his dad gave to him over Sarah as they escaped the night air, falling into their new house together. 
 Dale ’ s moment of pure panic was cut short by a small voice speaking through the door. 
 “ secret knock. 
 Please. 
 ” Zane took a patient step back and leaned up against the door. 
 “ come on honey. 
 You know it ’ s me.

 How does one unexpected God suddenly become the most powerful God?","The gods are divine beings. 
 Constantly falling in and out of existence just like the things they represent. 
 Some gods are eternal, like the God of light, or the god of electrons and so on and so forth.

 For settings, i usually just rack my brain for any particular name i like and extend other names from that. 
 So, a place named after something like a number "" 1 "" would be close by the river "" One "" and so on. 
 Race names are a bit odd. 
 In most cases, you can get away with naming them based off a physical description. 
 Usually if it's a pretty defining characteristics, it 'd work well enough. 
 Ex: Tall and dark - skinned dark elves or most real animals that are literally a genus and an species. 
 Honestly, if it's too much trouble, just name everything "" the great "" and start writing the plots and conflicts from there. 
 Go back and remember everything once you feel you 'd like to. 
 It's also useful for forcing you to build up more substantial, defined places / characters since there's no name to distinguish them."

 There was no info on the sensors. 
 I didn't get the "" Not a War "" part either so it wasn't something from the real world who got into the combat zones, so i engaged it because whatever. 
 It was weak now. 
 Died in two hits.

 So i assume the guys at least just forgot it here and it was supposed to be erased. 
 Had to leave for the base right after that because i was out of energy and i ' m not a big player, you know the drill."

 Every time he turned a corner in his house more of his pictures looked back at him in alien places. 
 As he approached his master bedroom he let out a soft cry. 
 He hadn't lived a good life, not by any means, but his life was better than a life under the symbol.

 A cross, inscribed with an infinite sign, in a star of David, which at each point rested a new sign. 
 But he knew the meaning, and it was fucking carved into every single picture in his house. 
 It was a source of popular religious and mathematical symbols. 
 It was given to anyone who didn't understand the sign. 
 A silly joke. 
 The symbol, like most bad things, was best forgotten."

 There, he would sit under the oak, and watch the first rays of sunlight peek over the lake."

 40 years old and just getting ready to be a father in under two weeks. 
 A genetic time bomb of a heart in my chest that historically goes off at 45 years and has proven fatal in the past, hopefully a heritage i don ’ T pass down to my son.

 Every step is a step in making me look and feel younger for the upcoming years. 
 I want decades. 
 I want to be there for every moment in his life."

 Worse.","I hovered above the child, listening to her sing, and watch her parents smile in awe of their offspring. 
 What an awful expression. 
 Such joy, and pride for another year. 
 I looked around for something to scare the big creature and its willing slaves. 
 Yet they were the only ones at the park this evening. 
 Awful.

 The parents were too difficult to control, they felt emotions strongly in this moment.

 I walk off into my own little world, and when i come to, i ' m always walking down this road. 
 There it is, my old bus stop. 
 That's where i decided my fate. 
 That's where i was nothing, where i was a fool and a liar and nothing.
